# Prometheus and Alertmanager ship with no built-in authentication of their
# own (unlike Grafana, which gets a real admin password -- see
# grafana-secret.tf). Both are reachable from monitoring_admin_cidr, and
# until this credential existed, anyone in that CIDR could hit either one's
# web UI/API directly -- run arbitrary PromQL against full cluster
# telemetry, or silence firing alerts via Alertmanager's API -- with zero
# login required. Same random-password-in-Secrets-Manager pattern as
# grafana_admin, consumed by modules/monitoring-ec2's user-data script to
# generate a bcrypt-hashed --web.config.file for both, and by Grafana's own
# datasource config so its dashboards keep working (Grafana talks to both
# over the same auth now, not the public internet).
