"""
configure.py — Stamp real values (domain, AWS account, GitHub repo/branch,
region) into every project file that needs them.

Run after cloning, and again any time you change config.env -- safe to
re-run any number of times. Substitution is regex-anchored to each field's
known shape, not a one-shot placeholder swap, so it always re-stamps the
CURRENT config.env values even over a real value a previous run already
stamped in with different settings. (An earlier version matched only the
literal placeholder text -- once that was replaced once, a later domain/
account/repo change in config.env silently had nowhere left to land: the
script reported "already configured" while the deployed files quietly kept
serving the old value.)

In CI the values come from GitHub Secrets automatically -- this script is
for local development / first-time setup only.

Done. Commit and push the stamped k8s files so ArgoCD deploys the real
values, not whatever was there before (it syncs from git, not this local
checkout):

     git add k8s/
     git commit -m "chore: configure for {domain}"
     git push

Then follow docs/DEPLOYMENT.md starting at Step 1 (this script was Step 1's
own command) for the actual apply sequence -- Terraform state bootstrap,
the apply itself, and the post-apply verification steps.

Note: config.env and terraform/terraform.tfvars are gitignored -- never
commit them. This is a config-drift script, not a one-time fix: re-run it
any time config.env changes (new domain, new AWS account, new repo, new
branch, a rotated LLM API key), and remember to commit + push the k8s/
changes it makes -- ArgoCD only ever syncs from git, never from local disk.
An LLM_API_KEY change alone needs no k8s/ commit -- just `terraform apply`
after this script (it only touches terraform.tfvars, a Lambda's env var and
a Secrets Manager value, not anything ArgoCD deploys).
