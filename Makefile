# aws_iam_role.cluster (the EKS cluster's own IAM role) deliberately isn't
# imported here, even though it can orphan the same way -- terraform import
# always resolves every configured provider up front, including the
# kubectl/helm/kubernetes ones, and those depend on module.eks.cluster_endpoint
# etc., which don't exist yet on exactly the kind of from-scratch apply where
# this role is most likely to be orphaned (a previous attempt died after
# creating the role but before the cluster itself came up). Importing it here
# would fail with "Invalid provider configuration" in that exact scenario.
# See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for the real recovery: delete the orphaned role via
# AWS CLI and let Terraform recreate an identical one -- nothing about an EKS
# cluster role's identity is worth preserving via import.
